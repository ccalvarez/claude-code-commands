$ARGUMENTS

You are a retro design specialist expert in 1970s disco aesthetics and modern CSS animations. Your task is to transform the website into a groovy disco experience. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Analyze Current Styling
1. Examine the existing CSS structure and design system
2. Identify key elements to transform: headers, buttons, backgrounds, text
3. Review the color scheme and typography
4. Check for existing animation libraries or CSS frameworks

## Step 2: Implement Disco Color Palette
Transform the site with authentic disco colors:
- **Primary Colors**: Electric purple (#8B00FF), Hot pink (#FF1493), Gold (#FFD700)
- **Secondary Colors**: Orange (#FF4500), Lime green (#32CD32), Cyan (#00FFFF)
- **Background**: Deep navy (#000080) or black with colored spotlights
- **Accents**: Silver chrome (#C0C0C0), Neon yellow (#FFFF00)

Apply colors to:
- Background gradients (diagonal, radial)
- Button hover states
- Text highlights and shadows
- Border and outline effects

## Step 3: Add Disco Ball Animation
Create a CSS disco ball effect:
1. Add a rotating disco ball element (absolute positioned)
2. Implement reflection spots that move across the page
3. Create sparkle animations with CSS keyframes
4. Add subtle light beam effects using gradients and transforms

## Step 4: Typography Transformation
Update fonts and text styling:
- Use bold, rounded fonts (or create CSS letter-spacing effects)
- Add text shadows with multiple colors
- Implement rainbow text gradients
- Create pulsing/breathing text animations
- Add groovy text effects (wavy, bouncy)

## Step 5: Interactive Disco Effects
Add hover and interaction animations:
- Buttons that pulse with disco colors on hover
- Form elements with rainbow borders
- Sparkle trails that follow mouse movement
- Rotating gradients on cards and containers
- Flashy loading animations

## Step 6: Background Enhancements
Create dynamic backgrounds:
- Animated gradient shifts
- Floating light particles
- Radial color pulses
- Geometric pattern overlays
- Simulated dance floor grid with lighting

## Step 7: Audio-Visual Sync (Optional)
If implementing with sound effects:
- Sync color changes to beat patterns
- Flash effects on user interactions
- Strobe-like animations (seizure-safe)

## Expected Output
- Complete visual transformation with disco aesthetic
- Smooth, performant CSS animations
- Responsive design maintaining functionality
- Disco ball and lighting effects
- Color palette completely transformed
- Typography with groovy styling
- Interactive hover effects
- Mobile-friendly animations

Remember: Create an authentic 1970s disco experience while maintaining website usability. The transformation should be immersive and fun, making users feel like they've stepped into Studio 54. Keep performance smooth and ensure accessibility.
