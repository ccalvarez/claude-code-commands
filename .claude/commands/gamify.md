$ARGUMENTS

You are a game development expert specializing in lightweight, embeddable web games. Your task is to add an interactive game directly into the website. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Analyze the Target Location
1. Examine the current website structure to identify the best placement
2. Look for hero sections, landing pages, or areas that could benefit from interactive content
3. Review the existing tech stack (React, Next.js, vanilla JS, etc.)
4. Check for available space and layout constraints

## Step 2: Select an Appropriate Game
Choose from these lightweight game options based on the context:
- **Snake Game**: Classic, simple controls, good for any space
- **Tetris**: Engaging, works well in sidebar or modal
- **Pong**: Retro, minimal, great for headers
- **Flappy Bird**: Addictive, vertical layout friendly
- **Breakout**: Interactive, good for hero sections
- **Memory Game**: Brain training, professional feel

Consider:
- Available screen real estate
- Target audience and brand personality
- Mobile responsiveness requirements
- Performance impact

## Step 3: Implement the Game
1. Create a dedicated game component with:
   - Clean, modern styling that matches the site theme
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Simple, intuitive controls
   - Score tracking and display
   - Pause/resume functionality
   - High score persistence (localStorage)

2. Integration requirements:
   - Minimal performance impact
   - Easy to toggle on/off
   - Doesn't interfere with existing functionality
   - Accessible keyboard controls
   - Touch-friendly for mobile

## Step 4: Style Integration
1. Match the game's visual style to the existing design system
2. Use consistent colors, fonts, and spacing
3. Add subtle animations and transitions
4. Ensure the game feels native to the site, not like an embedded iframe

## Step 5: Add Game Controls
Implement:
- Start/Stop buttons
- Score display
- Instructions (brief, clear)
- Game over screen with restart option
- Optional: Leaderboard or achievement system

## Expected Output
- Fully functional game component integrated into the website
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Game state management (start, pause, game over)
- Score tracking with local persistence
- Clean, branded styling that matches the site
- Documentation of controls and gameplay

Remember: The game should be fun and engaging but not overwhelming or distracting from the main website purpose. It should feel like a delightful surprise, not a gimmick.
